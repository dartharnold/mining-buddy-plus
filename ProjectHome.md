# Mining Buddy Plus #

Due to lack of time on my part and the fact that the code in this project would need a complete overhaul to work with modern PHP, I have stopped updating this code.

This is a branch of Mining Buddy for Eve Online.  The goal of this project is to improve on the current 0.8.5 code and add more functionality into the tool.

Addition Ideas that I would like to work towards include:
Fleet Participation, Mining Optimizer (What rocks should be mind for mineral output), and more.

## **Features added:** ##
  * Change what email address Mining Buddy uses in site config file
  * Change IGB (_In Game Browser_) to look the same as out of game in site config file
  * Option to pull Ore/Salvage values from Eve-Central
  * Pilot image added in page header

## **Update added:** ##
  * **Lotto is Back!!**
  * Now uses CAK (_Customizable API Key_) released with Incarna 1.1
